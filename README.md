Just another repository


My professional background is in Industrial and Mechanical Engineering and I enjoy reading a variety of other subjects, including literature and history. I have professional translation experience in the engineering and applied science fields and published and presented an article at COMSOL Boston 2013.

I have a particular interest in aeronautics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics and video games,  and flair for engineering.
